								Did you know that Vernie can talk to you? In fact, LEGO速 BOOST
								models make lots of cool sounds, but you have to make sure the
								volume on your tablet is up. Unlike LEGO速 MINDSTORMS, all sounds
								come from the tablet app, not the Move Hub.
							</p>

							<p className='answer'>
								You can also speak to Vernie, but the microphone on your tablet
								will need to be enabled. Make sure the LEGO速 BOOST App has the
								proper permissions to access your microphone and no external
								Bluetooth Speakers are connected - some speakers disable the
								microphone while connected.
